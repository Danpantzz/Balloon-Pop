                <p>
                        Balloon Pop is an arcade-like game built using the Flutter Flame engine. Try to beat your
                        highscore
                        each time you play, as the game gets more difficult the longer you last! Created for a final
                        project at RIT.
                </p>

                <ol>
                        <li>Came up with an idea for a simple arcade game that involved popping balloons</li>
                        <li>Researched Flame and different ways of laying out the app navigation</li>
                        <li>Settled on overlays, and found different a Flame tutorial that explained in depth on how to
                                make a flame game</li>
                        <li>Set up the main game class, where everything is initialized and the game loop is started
                        </li>
                        <li>Wrote a class that can take in multiple types of balloons to make creating different
                                versions easier and less redundant</li>
                        <li>Created the game loop, where the balloons rise up, pop if they leave the screen, causing the
                                player to lose a life. Popping a balloon before it leaves increases the players score.
                        </li>
                        <li>Created the overlays and set them up with different states such as the pause state when
                                pressing the pause button.</li>
                        <li>Finally, I added music and sound effects, and volume controls.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Set Backs / Glitches</h2>
                <ul>
                        <li>After a while of playing, the sound effects may become delayed.</li>
                        <li>Music is restarted when changing the volume due to FlameAudio not allowing variables to
                                initialize music. (could be fixed by creating the audio on the main page with
                                AudioPlayers, but it was too late to change it)</li>
                        <li>Back button doesn't work on certain overlays due to the WillPopScope not being called</li>
