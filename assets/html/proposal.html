    <h1>Balloon Pop!</h1>

    <hr>

    <h2>Developer</h2>
    <p>Daniel McErlean</p>

    <h2>Concept</h2>
    <p>Balloons float up from the bottom to the top of the screen and the player must pop them before they reach the top. Players must also beware not to pop the skull balloons. If a balloon reaches the top, or if the player pops a skull balloon, then they lose a life.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p>The player has 3 lives, and must pop as many balloons as they can before they run out of lives. The balloons start to appear faster over time and the player must prevent themselves from popping the skull balloons, as well as preventing balloons from leaving the screen. Once the player runs out of lives, the game is over and they can play again.</p>
    <h3>Score</h3>
    <p>Score is earned by popping balloons. Some balloons may be harder to pop (may take 2 taps), while others may might move faster. These balloons will give the player more points. Try to beat your highscore!</p>

    <h3>Coins (Stretch Goal)</h3>
    <p>Coins will drop from some balloons at random. The player can spend coins to unlock different themes/backgrounds</p>

    <h2>Genre</h2>
    <p>minigame, arcade-like</p>

    <h2>Platform</h2>
    <p>Mobile, Android</p>

    <h2>Aesthetics</h2>
    <p>Portrait mode, cartoonish-style graphics. The balloons will be multiple different colors on either a blue or dark background.</p>

    <h2>Application Functionality</h2>
    <p>Players can navigate between the Game page, a Settings page, a Highscore page and Store page (not in mockup). The Game page will be the main game, where the players pop the balloons. The Settings page will allow player the pause the game, change volume controls, look at how to play, and quit mid-game. The Highscore page will display the player's highscore, and the Store page will show the player's coins and decorations they can purchase.</p>
